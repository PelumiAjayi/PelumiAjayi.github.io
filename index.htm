	<!-- IMPROVEMENTS I CAN MAKE
	* The content of the drop down menu is annoyingly small and I don't know how to fix it...yet
	* Make it so that I can also upload files onto the website
	* Dropdown inside a dropdown
	* Make an active page with books I have read, books I'm currently reading and books I want to read
	* Have a "Syllabus" tab on the drop down menu
	* Upload pictures of things I have 3D printed and other projects I have worked on in the past
	* To upload things, I'll need to create some sort of a database for the website where all the info are being stored
	*
